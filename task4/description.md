# Pipeline Description

### 1. Data Source Assessment:
   - **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure, format, and schema of the new data source
   - **Data Profiling**: Identify data types, missing values, duplicates, and anomalies

### 2. Data Ingestion:
   - **Incremental Data Ingestion**: Use a mechanism to identify new or updated records since the last ingestion. This can be achieved using:
     - **Timestamps**: If the data source has timestamps for each record
     - **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Tools like Apache Kafka or Debezium can be used to capture changes in the source database
     - **Unique Identifiers**: If each record has a unique identifier, compare it against the existing data to identify new records
   - **Historical Data Ingestion**: Import the complete dataset initially to ensure the availability of historical data

### 3. Data Storage:
   - **Database Design**: Design a relational or NoSQL database schema (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) based on the data model required by the team
   - **Schema Evolution**: Ensure the database schema can accommodate changes over time without disrupting the existing data

### 4. Data Transformation:
   - **ETL Process**:
     - **Extraction**: Fetch data from the source
     - **Transformation**: Apply required transformations using tools like Apache Spark, Apache Beam, or Python libraries such as pandas
     - **Loading**: Load the transformed data into the target database
   - **Data Modeling**: Implement specific data modeling techniques like star schema, snowflake schema, or other relevant techniques to solve the team's problem

### 5. Data Quality:
   - **Data Validation**: Implement validation checks to ensure data integrity and consistency
   - **Monitoring & Logging**: Monitor the pipeline for anomalies, failures, or discrepancies
   - **Alerting**: Set up alerts to notify stakeholders immediately in case of pipeline failures or data quality issues
   - **Data Lineage**: Document the data flow and transformations for traceability and auditability

### 6. Pipeline Orchestration:
   - **Workflow Management**: Use workflow orchestration tools like Apache Airflow, Luigi, or Prefect to schedule and manage the data pipeline
   - **Dependency Management**: Handle dependencies between tasks and ensure proper execution order

### 7. Error Handling & Recovery:
   - **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - **Error Logging**: Log detailed error messages for troubleshooting
   - **Manual Intervention**: Provide a mechanism to manually intervene and fix issues if automatic recovery fails

### 8. Monitoring & Alerting:
   - **Pipeline Monitoring**: Monitor pipeline health, execution status, and performance metrics
   - **Alerting System**: Integrate with alerting systems like PagerDuty, Slack, or email notifications for immediate alerts on failures or anomalies

### Technology Stack:
   - **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL, Amazon RDS, or Apache Cassandra for storing the transformed data
   - **Data Processing**: Apache Spark for large-scale data processing, Python (pandas, numpy) for data transformation, and Apache Kafka or Debezium for Change Data Capture
   - **Workflow Orchestration**: Apache Airflow for managing and scheduling the data pipeline
   - **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog for centralized logging

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Environment Setup**: Set up development, staging, and production environments with the required infrastructure and tools
2. **Prototype**: Develop a prototype to validate the data ingestion, transformation, and loading process
3. **Testing**: Perform thorough testing of the pipeline to ensure data quality, reliability, and performance
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the pipeline to the production environment and monitor its performance
5. **Documentation**: Document the pipeline architecture, data flow, transformations, and monitoring processes for future reference and troubleshooting
